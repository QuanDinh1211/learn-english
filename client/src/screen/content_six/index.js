                    I've learned so much today! This is the best FREE training
                    I've watched in my 3years of Freelancing life. Thank you
                    Vanessa for being so generous, you gave me so much clarity!

                    Your free training is INVALUABLE. ðŸ’¯ It's less than 2hrs,
                    but I spent twice as long on it because I wanted to soak in
                    EVERYTHING!

                    I'm blown away at how great this webinar is. I did not
                    expect to want to watch it all the way through. Actually,
                    I'm ticked I didn't make more time to watch it.

                    I finished that training video you sent me. I took massive
                    notes from each slide... you suggested it was 90 mins but I
                    made it like 3 hours from all the notes you provided.

                    I attended your free webinar and there are more useful
                    resources in that webinar. I too attended many free webinars
                    from others but this one is awesome!!!
